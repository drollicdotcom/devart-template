One of the core goals of Dremer is uniqueness.  To meet this goal, Dreamer makes use of randomization on 3 different levels:

The first level is provided by the user in the form of the input phrase. I will make no attempt to quantify the "interestingness" of individual input phrases, however, the sheer act of requiring a user to provide a phrase inherently seeds Dreamer for a unique composition. The input phrase represents the primary creative element in the entire process. All subsequent processing steps are purely a function of this creativity.

The second level involves the utilization of large and well indexed image databases, specifically Google Search and FlickR.  These databases contain a rich mapping of keywords to diverse imagery. Whatâ€™s more, the images used from any individual query are selected at random from the hundreds, often thousands, of results.

The third level is randomization coded at various levels within the software.  Just a couple examples include:

- Randomization of various parameters, albeit bounded, for the image analysis algorithms.
- Randomization of the choice of specific brush image for every individual painting stroke

The result is that, even with the same input text, and even with the same input images, the end results are still unique. 

Here are a few concrete examples -- the following dreams are the results for the same input text -- "Abstraction."

![Abstraction Number 3](../project_images/abstraction_no_3.png?raw=true "Abstraction Number 3")

![Abstraction Number 4](../project_images/abstraction_no_4.png?raw=true "Abstraction Number 4")
