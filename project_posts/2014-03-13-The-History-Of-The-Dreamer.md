I first began working on the Dreamer in 2005.  I was becoming interested in how computers could be used to generate something resembling art, and began exploring concept ideas for applications I could build.  But what would it produce?  It was a question I thought about for months.  

I knew I didn't want it to produce something geometric or purely mathematical, like 3D objects or fractals.  I think those renderings are beautiful, but I had written variants of those in college.

I knew I wanted the app to take some meaningful input from a person.  A seed, but again, not something random or something that's simply broken down and turned into a number in the end.  I wanted a seed that was not only meaningful to a person, but would also be used as-is. 

And I knew that I wanted the end result to have some reflection of that seed.  Perhaps not always, but many times.  I wanted the user to be able to see elements of the input in the output.  

It was during this time when I first came across all the great internet APIs that were springing up.  Yahoo, Google and FlickR were all developing powerful APIs to their search engines, including their image search engines.  And this is when I had the idea to turn text into a collection of images.  With this core idea, it was just a matter of deciding what was an interesting way to combine these images into something unique.

A year or so later and Dreamer was born.

I wrote it as a C#/.NET app which used C/C++ under the covers for all the hardcore analysis and rendering logic.

Dreamer was first released as a free Windows desktop application, but very few people actually installed it.  Big surprise.  And honestly, pretty damn frustrating given all the work I had done to make the UI look "cool" (the main window was actually oval shaped).

So, I turned it into a server driven web application allowing anyone to submit a phrase which would be later processed by a server I ran.  The results were then uploaded to a shared blog.  Over the next 4 years or so, roughly 3,000 "dreams" were created by random people all over the world.  Viewing those creations every night was an absolute pleasure.

Hands down, the most interesting use of the Dreamer was when someone used various dreams as textures for their clothing in Second Life.   

Somewhere in 2009/2010, the server box was updated and the Dreamer finally went offline.  Fast forward to 2013 when I stumbled across this contest.  

The Dreamer's last hurrah.
