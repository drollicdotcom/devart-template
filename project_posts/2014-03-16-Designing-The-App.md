As I've mentioned in an earlier post, I will be reworking the Dreamer's engine into a new Windows-based application for this contest.  I've chosen WPF as my framework.  The resolution indepdendence of WPF will give me the ability to render this app on a display of any size with beautiful results. My idea for the interface is to keep it as simple as possible, incorporating the following:

- Full screen app
- An obvious focus on rendering the dream on as much of the screen as possible. 
- Basic input text box that lays out nicely no matter the screen size
- Basic action button that kicks off the intial dreaming process, lays out nicely no matter the screen size
- Continuous processing with new dreams created and displayed using what's currently in the input textbox

Basic sketch of what I'm thinking:

Yes, it's very simple.  But I don't want the focus to be on the app.  I want the focus to be on the results.
