Just a quick post to show how the final app looks:

![FinalApp](../project_images/DreamerApp.png?raw=true "FinalApp")

Pretty much identical to the originl sketch, but that wasn't hard as there's not much to it.  By Design.  The focus is on the final dream and not the input box or the button.  And again, because it's WPF, the textbox and the button will scale up nicely.

What you can't see from the screenshot is that the app, once dreaming is initiated, will endlessly continue to create new dreams for whatever words are in the input textbox.  As each new creation is completed, it's rendered in the app.
