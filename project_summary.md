## Description
The Dreamer is an application that will turn any word or phrase into a completely unique abstract work of art -- a "dream" that has some strange yet meaningful relationship to the input. The results are always unique.

My motivation behind making the Dreamer was to discover a kind of computer-based art that didn't rely purely on numbers, formulas or other foundations that didn't utilize meaningful input from a person.  I wanted the foundation to be something meaningful.  For this, I chose a text input.  The next step was then connecting this to meaningful source material.  The image search APIs served this purpose perfectly by turning this text into a connected set of imagery from which the art could then be generated.
