## Description
The Dreamer is an application that will turn any word or phrase into a completely unique abstract work of art -- a "dream" that has some strange yet meaningful relationship to the input. The results are always unique.

My motivation behind making the Dreamer was to discover a kind of computer-based art that didn't rely purely on numbers, formulas or other foundations that didn't make use of creative input from a person.  I wanted the foundation to be something meaningful.  And from that foundation, to create something entirely unique.
